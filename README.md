# Datasets-Trained
This repository all those datasets that I have worked on whether it be a kaggle Dataset or learnings from an Online course,where:
1. assignment.ipynb is the notebook of the data that I worked on. The data was collected from kaggle and had Anonymous feature names. I achieved an accuracy of 90% after preprocessing, training and testing the data.
2. MSP-prediction.ipynb predicts Minimum support price commodities given various factors. Data was collected from a Hackerearth challenge.
3. book-price.ipynb predicts the price of a book given factors Author, Synopsis, Edition, Ratings, Reviews etc. Data was collected from MachnineHack.
4. feature_engineering-LSF.ipynb and DataFrame.ipynb contains cleaning, preprocessing and analysis of the telemetry data (data colleted from satellite) to figure out the anomalies among various features of satellites.
5. Rest files contain the Assignment work of an online coursera specialisation **Applied Machine Learning in python**.
